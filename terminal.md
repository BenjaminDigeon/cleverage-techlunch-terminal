#### Punched card

- Invented in **1725** for the control of a loom.
- Then use for playing back performances on a harmonium in **1881**.
- *Herman Hollerith* invented a electromechanical punched card tabulator used in the **1890** United States Census.
- Is company was later amalgamated with others then rename in **1924** the *International Business Machines Corporation*.

Note: So for now we just talk about tabulator, electromechanical computer are invented around 1938, then vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits in 1942. Principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper and first run in 1948.
